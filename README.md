# Sketch2Ckt
A CV/GenAI project to convert hand drawn circuit diagrams into digital structures (e.g SPICE)

This work aims to advance on the motivation from my earlier project Hand-drawn Circuit Component Recognition from 2022 https://github.com/apurvaumredkar/Hand-drawn-Circuit-Component-Recognition where we will leverage new models from 2025 to:
- Detect circuit components using DETR fine-tuned using few shot learning.
- Construct circuit graph using VLMs for connectivity reasoning.
